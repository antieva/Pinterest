## Description
This is a rebuild Pinterest: a website that designed to discover information on the World Wide Web, mainly using images and on a shorter scale, GIFs and videos.

A user can:

#### Create a free account with an email and password.
 The user will be asked to fill out a few details such as their name, age, gender, language and country before they will be instructed to pick at least five categories to follow so that Pinterest can start showing them personalized pins based on their interests.

#### Open their profile, change their data.
 In the top right corner, the user should see their name and profile picture, which they can click on to go to their profile. (If user has not yet set up a profile picture, they can do so by clicking the three dots in the top right corner, selecting Settings from the dropdown menu and navigating to Profile in the lefthand menu.)

#### See three tabs in their profile:

 Boards: Displays all the pinboards user created.

 Pins: Displays all the things user recently pinned.

 Tried: All the pins user tried for themselves and left feedback on.

#### Save pins found on Pinterest
 To save a pin user has to hover a cursor over the pin and click the red Save button that appears in the top right corner. User will be asked which board they want to save it to.


### Future functionality:

#### Save pins user have on their computer or what they found on the Web
 The user has to navigate to their profile, click either your Pins tab or Boards tab and look for the Create Pin button or Create Board button to the far left of your pins/boards.

 Create Pin: If the image is on the user's computer, they can upload it to the web. If what they want to pin is on the web, the they have to copy and paste the direct URL in the given field and they will be able to select specific image they want to pin.

 Create Board: to create different boards and to keep pins organized. Name the board and make it Secret (private) if the user likes.

#### Follow other users
 If user likes the boards and pins of specific users, he can follow them so that their stuff will show up on his personal homepage board feed (when user is signed in to Pinterest).

 The user has to click the username of any Pinterest user to pull up their profile and click Follow at the top of their profile to follow that user’s boards or the user can alternatively follow specific boards of that user by clicking the individual Follow button beneath each board.

#### Interact with Other Users
 Save: User can save the pin to one of their own boards.

 Send: Send a pin to other users on Pinterest.

 Comment: the user can leave a comment under the board or pinned item.​

 Add a photo or note: If user tried the pin (such as a recipe, a craft, etc.) then they can upload their own photo and add a comment about what they did or didn't like.

#### Discover new things on Pinterest
 To find what is new the user can browse through the unique categories Pinterest has available in the top right corner, marked by the hamburger button.

 The user can find the following categories plus many others here:

  Popular: See what kind of stuff is generating the most interest, the most saves and the most comments on Pinterest.

  Everything: Roll a mouse over this option to display a list of categories of things user can browse through.

  Videos: Although images are the main things that get shared on Pinterest, there’s also a special section for videos too.

  Gifts: Users like to recommend things they can make or products they like on popular shopping sites.
